This is a website for a interior design company, FLEXOR.

This website contains a homepage and a contact page, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have taken a modern and minimalistic approach while designing the website so that the users are not overwhelmed. I have used contrasting shades of the same colour , which makes it monochromatic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used media query in CSS for the responsive design, I have not used any other framework
This website supports the following devices,
-Mobile
-Tablet
-Laptop/Desktop

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problems with this approach was implementing responsive font size, JavaScript was not running as expected, sizing the image to look more blended with the rest of the content.

I used 'VW' units to implement the font size across all devices.

DOM components were not mounting as expected due to delay in loading the webpage , I used a onload listener to wait for the page to load and then run the script.

I used fixed sizes for the images for mobile and tablet device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web sections like the pricing , brands and team members were not able to be viewed in a row like it used to in desktops/ laptops, I made them to be viewed in a column instead for much better experience and same goes for the footer content

I had problem setting up the hero image in the homepage in all devices, finally I removed the specified height of the container , so that the height is adjusted according to the screen size and content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote the code in a clean indented format , and wrote comments wherever necessary.
I have used a simple and efficient file structure to access the contents of the webpage.
